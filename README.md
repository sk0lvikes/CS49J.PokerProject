Gameplay

The game starts with each player (including AIs) being dealt two cards face down ("hole cards").
A round of betting commences.
Three shared community cards ("the Flop") are dealt to the middle of the table.
Another round of betting occurs.
One more community card ("the Turn") is dealt followed by a round of betting.
The final community card ("the River") is dealt followed by the final round of betting.
The best poker hand is determined by combining any two of each player's private hole cards with the five community cards on the board. 
The player with the best hand or last remaining if other fold wins the pot.
